I like to offer practical courses in which students can apply what they have learned directly to a project.

I therefore greatly enjoy to teach the so-called "empiric-experimental project seminar" to undergraduate students. In this seminar which is a mandatory part of the undergraduate curriculum of psychology at German universities, students learn about the scientific process by planning and conducting an experiment. They learn how to find a research question, conduct a literature research, elaborate an experimental design, collect and analyse data and write a research report. Furthermore, I cover topics like open science principles and good scientific practice within this course.

In addition, I love to teach basic wet lab skills to psychology students. In a seminar called "Measuring Hormones 101" I teach how cortisol can be measured in saliva and how this measurement can be used in experimental studies. After learning basics about the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and basic principles of Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISAs), students conduct a small experiment in which they collect saliva samples (usually, we study the cortisol awakening response). Using these samples, I instruct them how to run an ELISA themselves. Finally, we analyse the data statistically and write a short research report about our findings.
