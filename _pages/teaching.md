I enjoy teaching practical courses, in which students can apply their gained knowledge in the course of mini projects, e.g. by planning and conducting an experiment, analyzing saliva samples in the wet lab, or running statistical analysis scripts in R. My classes cover topics of how to find a research question, conduct a literature research, elaborate an experimental design, collect, preprocess and analyse data in biological psychology and how to write a research report. Whenever possible, I cover principles of open and reproducible science within my classes.
