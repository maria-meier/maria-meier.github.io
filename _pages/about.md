I am a PhD student at the [Department of Clinical Neuropsychology](https://www.psychologie.uni-konstanz.de/pruessner/) of the [University of Constance](https://www.uni-konstanz.de), Germany, where I currently work in the group of Prof. Dr. Jens Pruessner. 

I am interested in why stress-related diseases like depression, and metabolic diseases like obesity often go hand in hand. On this endeavour, I study the impact of sweeteners on  psychophysiological stress and relaxation responses. On the long run, I would like to investigate the role of reward, motivation and pleasure in the emergence of symptoms like anhedonia and obesity.

I like longitudinal data analysis using multilevel mixed models and making graphs. 

I try to make research accessible and transparent both for scientists and the public. This is why I follow open science principles, and engage in science communication whenever possible.

In case of any questions, don't hesitate to reach out!
