Hello.

I am a PhD student in the [Department of Clinical Neuropsychology](https://www.psychologie.uni-konstanz.de/pruessner/) at the [University of Constance](https://www.uni-konstanz.de), Germany, supervised by Prof. Dr. Jens Pruessner. 

My research interest covers _stress_ and its relation to _metabolic health_, the interaction of physiological stress systems, and longitudinal data analysis using multilevel mixed models.
