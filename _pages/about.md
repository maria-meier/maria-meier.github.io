I am a Postdoc at the [Department of Psychology](https://www.psychologie.uni-konstanz.de/pruessner/) of the [University of Konstanz](https://www.uni-konstanz.de), Germany, and at the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Research Department of the [University Psychiatric Clinics Basel (UPK)](https://www.upk.ch/), Switzerland.

My research focuses on acute and chronic effects of stress on health and behavior, with a special focus on the regulatory interactions between acute stress and the metabolic system. During my doctoral thesis at the University of Konstanz, I investigated the short-term effects of glucose intake on psychophysiological responses to stress and relaxation. Using endocrine and cardiovascular markers of different stress-reactive systems (i.e., the HPA axis and the autonomic nervous system [ANS]), we found that glucose has the potential to increase the endocrine stress response. In my current work funded by the Messmer Foundation and the Young Scholar Fund of the University of Konstanz, I investigate mediators and short-term behavioral cognitive consequences of this amplified response pattern. 

I complement this line of research by studying links between stress in childhood and adult metabolic health. Thereby, I focus on high risk populations which display a chronic disruption of the stress and/or the metabolic system.

I like longitudinal data analyses using growth curves and making graphs.
