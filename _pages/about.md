I am a PhD student at the [Department of Clinical Neuropsychology](https://www.psychologie.uni-konstanz.de/pruessner/) of the [University of Constance](https://www.uni-konstanz.de), Germany, where I currently work in the group of Prof. Dr. Jens Pruessner. 

I am interested in why stress-related diseases like depression and metabolic diseases like obesity often occur together. On this venture, I study how non-caloric and caloric sweeteners affect stress and relaxation responses. On the long run, I want to find out how  stress, energy metabolism, and reward impact the emergence of symptoms like anhedonia and obesity.

I like longitudinal data analysis using multilevel mixed models and making graphs. 

I try to make research accessible and transparent both for scientists and the public. This is why I follow open science principles, and engage in science communication whenever possible.
